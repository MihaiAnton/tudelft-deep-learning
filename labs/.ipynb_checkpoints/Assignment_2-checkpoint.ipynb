    "## A2.1 Linear layer - backward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "In A2.1 we will build upon the linear layer from A1.1 and implement the backward pass. We then perform a forward pass and backward pass on some dummy input and compare the gradients to the Pytorch implementation of a Linear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backpropagation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is an efficient algorithm to modularly calculate the gradients of the loss $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the trainable parameters in our network. The gradient is used in (Stochastic) Gradient Descent to update the trainable parameters to minimize the loss. For now we only consider how to calculate the gradients in the `backward` function of a layer, later on we will also implement the update step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward pass of a linear layer is defined as $y=wx+b$, where $w$ and $b$ are the trainable weight and bias parameters, respectively. The gradients w.r.t. $w$ and $b$ are then calculated using the chain rule as\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial w}, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial b} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial b}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y}$ is the *upstream gradient*, i.e. the gradient flowing from the deeper layer into the current layer. The upstream gradient will be the input variable in our `backward` function.\n",
    "The other two terms are the *local gradients* and will be computed inside the `backward` function as\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial w}=x, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial b}=1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the input of the layer $x$ is used for computing the gradient in the backward pass. We therefore need to store this value during the forward pass as a cache variable so that we don't have to compute it again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, since the shallower layer also requires an upstream gradient, our `backward` future needs to return a *downstream gradient*. The downstream gradient of a layer is simply its upstream gradient times the local gradient of its ouput with respect to its input: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}$. For a linear layer $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}=w$ and so $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us further clarify using an example with a two-layer neural network. The network output is given by\n",
    "$$y_2 = w_2 y_1 + b_2 = w_2 (w_1 x_1 + b_1) + b_2.$$\n",
    "The gradients for the first layer are calculated using the chain rule:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_1} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_2} \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial y_1} \\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial w_1} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_1} \\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial w_1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of layer 2, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_2}$ is the upstream gradient, $\\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial y_1} = \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial x_2} = w_2$ is the local gradient, and $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_2} \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial y_1} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_1}$ is the downstream gradient. From the perspective of layer 1, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_1}$ is the upstream gradient.\n",

    "The class labels `y` are [one-hot encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot#Machine_learning_and_statistics), i.e. for each class a binary value indicates whether the sample belongs to it or not. For instance, given classes `1,2,3,4,5` the one-hot encoding of class `4` is given by `[0,0,0,1,0]`. One-hot encoding is a natural way to represent class labels in a classification task since a neural network outputs a class probability vector. `[0,0,0,1,0]` then simply corresponds to a 0% chance of the sample belonging the classes `1,2,3,5` and a 100% chance of it belonging to class `4`."

    "The network should now successfully converge within a reasonable number of iterations and solve the XOR problem with 100% accuracy. You trained your first neural network, great job! This is still a relatively primitive optimization algorithm and we will dive more in depth into optimizing neural networks in later assignments.\n",

    "Replace the ReLU non-linearity by the Sigmoid function and train the network again. You will see that the network has much more difficulty converging - in fact, you might need to increase the number of `optim_steps` to `500`. If you look at the loss graph you'll see that the network initially learns quickly, i.e. the loss rapidly decreases, but learning slows down far before reaching 100% accuracy. Since the network parameters are updated by gradient descent, slow learning simply means that the gradients have become small. To understand why this happens, let's again look at the Sigmoid function $\\sigma(x)$ and its derivative $\\sigma'(x)$:\n"

    "So far the classifier scores predicted by our network (also called 'logits') were unbounded and we simply trained the network to minimize the mean squared error between the scores and the one-hot encoded labels. However, in a classification task we would like to interpret the output of our network as class probabilities, i.e. for all inputs $x$ and all classes $k$ we should have $$0 \\leq P(Y=k|X=x) \\leq 1, \\qquad \\sum_kP(Y=k|X=x) = 1.$$\n",

    "The Softmax layer is a vector extension of the Sigmoid function and so unfortunately comes with the same saturation problem causing learning to slow down. Luckily we can overcome this by replacing the MSE loss by the Cross Entropy (CE) loss:\n",

    "The Softmax layer and Cross Entropy loss are used together so often that they are implemented as a single function in Pytorch as `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`. Below we have implemented the CE loss with Softmax so we can use it to train our network. Feel free to go over the code, but you do not need to understand it exactly as the implementation is not very straightforward."

    "## [EXTRA] A2.7 MNIST handwritten digit classification\n",
    "In this extra exercise you will use your neural network to solve a real-world classification problem: classifying handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 and a test set of 10,000 samples of 28x28 pixels, which we will flatten to a 1D vector representation to feed into the neural network. In every training iteration we will sample a random batch of 64 data samples (without replacement) to calculate the loss, gradients and update the weights. This random sampling is where the 'Stochastic' in Stochastic Gradient Descent comes from. After every epoch, i.e. after having processed all sampels in the training set, we will evaluate the model on the test set.\n",

From the next assignment onwards we will start using more and more built-in PyTorch functionality and will get to know some more advanced methods for training neural networks. Also, we will implement the most prominent building block of modern computer vision: the convolutional layer."
